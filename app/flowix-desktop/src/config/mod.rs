//! Configuration & access-control layer for the agent runtime.
//!
//! Four closely related concerns live here:
//!
//! - [`user`] 鈥?user-level settings: legacy AI migration data, preferences
//!   (json), theme, agent persona. Legacy data is persisted at
//!   `~/.mdx/agent-config.toml`; active DSH settings use its own YAML file.
//!   Owns the `atomic_write_json`
//!   helper used by sibling stores.
//! - [`access`] 鈥?agent-access registry: which folders + notebooks the AI
//!   agent is allowed to see. Persisted at `~/.mdx/agent-access.json`.
//!   Distinct from the notebook registry so users can grant/revoke AI access
//!   without touching the notebook registry itself.
//! - [`path_scope`] 鈥?tiny pure helper: is `path` inside `root`? Used by
//!   access checks, dialog code, and security-bookmark filtering.
//! - [`security_bookmark`] 鈥?macOS security-scoped bookmarks for
//!   user-selected directories that survive across launches. Sibling of
//!   `user`/`access` but only meaningful on macOS; on other platforms the
//!   store is still constructed but never gains entries.
//!
//! All four write through `user::atomic_write_json` so disk failures never
//! leave the in-memory state ahead of disk.
